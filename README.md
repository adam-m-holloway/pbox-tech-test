Test completed by Adam Holloway. All tasks have been completed. Details of work done below.

- Replaced SCSS with Styled-Components for finer control and added basic styling
- Replaced JavaScript with TypeScript for type safety
- Used React Testing Library for unit tests
- Used React Router DOM for routing between home, product and error page
